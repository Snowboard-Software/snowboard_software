# Welcome to Snowboard

Snowboard connects directly with your cloud data warehouse. It needs access to the system database and tables of the warehouse (e.g. in `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`).

Snowboard then provides the ability to quickly and automatically:

* profile data
* view access rights and ownership
* document information objects
* understand relationships between tables
* search everything
