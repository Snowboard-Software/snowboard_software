This setup requires to manually add the Teams app with the correct endpoints to your Tenant.



## Tips for talking with Dot

1. To speak about a new topic, start a new conversation with `@Dot` in a group channel or chat.&#x20;
2. In a group channel follow up questions can be directly asked in the thread using the whole thread as context. No additional `@Dot` is needed.
3. In a chat Dot will automatically use the previous 3 messages as context, unless you reset it with `@Dot reset`
4. If Dot did not get it right, just rephrase your question and try again. It can help to look at the found data source to see which questions Dot might answer on it.

5.  To analyze complex topics it can help to break the questions up in multiple parts:\
    **What's our total revenue per country and its percentage change over time?**

    -> Show me total revenue over time (1)\
    -> Split it by country (2)\
    -> Calculate percentage change of revenue over time (3)\


    This helps Dot to build up context first. Most great things are created iteratively. üõ∂‚õµüö¢\

6. Dot is trained to analyze data, not to configure visualizations (yet). It can not build a pie chart. üç∞ But it can format the output data and thus influence the chart, e.g. filter by dimensions or aggregate data differently. The goal of Dot is to come up with the best visualization to answer the question itself.



## Permissions

Dot uses group-based permissions to control access. This means a user‚Äôs ability to access data via Dot depends on the groups they belong to.

In Microsoft Teams, Dot distinguishes between two types of user contexts:

**1. Direct Messages**

* Dot is used in a 1:1 conversation with an individual user.
* The user is identified by their email address (e.g., claude.shannon@bell.com).
* On first interaction, Dot automatically creates a user profile using default settings.\


**2. Chats and Team Channels**

* Dot is used in a group context‚Äîeither a group chat or a team channel.
* Dot creates a shared user profile for the group or channel, not for each individual.
* All users within that group or channel will have the same permissions in Dot.
* This is useful for managing access by organizational domain or function, such as having separate permissions for a marketing channel and a finance channel.
* Example user ID for a team channel:&#x20;

Admins can assign different groups (and thus different permissions) to these shared group-level users, allowing tailored access control without managing individual users within each channel.
