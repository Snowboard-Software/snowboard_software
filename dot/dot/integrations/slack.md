### Slack Data Handling

What Dot reads

* Only messages where it’s invoked (@Dot) and, by default, subsequent messages in that thread while Dot is active there.
* Dot does not read unrelated channel messages.



Private channels

* Adding Dot to a private channel does not grant it access to past history.
* Dot can only see messages where it’s invoked or within threads it’s participating in.
* Non-Dot messages remain invisible to Dot.



Direct messages (optional)

* DMs can be enabled by admins. These interactions are stored like channel interactions and are auditable.



Retention & admin audit

* We securely store only interactions involving Dot to provide context and auditability.
* Admins can review them in Admin Console → History.
* Workspace data deletion is available on request.
