# DuckDB

1. Get your token on [Motherduck Settings](https://app.motherduck.com/settings)

2.  Write your connection string

    It follows this pattern. `md:<database_name>?motherduck_token=<your_token>`\
    e.g.: `md:sample_data?motherduck_token=eyABC...`



**Notes**

The Motherduck connector currently requires DuckDB to be on v.0.10.2

If there is another way you'd like to access DuckDB, please [talk to us](../support.md).
