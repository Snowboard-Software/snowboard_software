# Chat

Data is stored in complex data models and insights are scattered across hundreds or more dashboards and visualizations. The few experts that can navigate this complexity become a bottleneck for the organization.&#x20;

Instead of creating Jira-Tickets or following up 3 times on an e-mail, you can just ask Dot - the data bot. Dot is trained by the data team to answer all the flexbile and nuanced questions about your business you care about.&#x20;

### Examples

Let's look at some potential questions for an online-shop that sells ramen üçú and similar products.

1. **Ask an ambigious question, clarify what you mean, get the answer.**&#x20;

2. **Ask questions that need a deep understanding of your companies data model (e.g. need of joins).**

3. **Ask follow up questions!**

4. **Saying "I don't know" is one of the most important answers in analytics.**

With Dot you can just ask and get an answer, and ask again, and again, and again.
