# Chat

Data is stored in complex data models and insights are scattered across hundreds or more dashboards and visualizations. The few experts that can navigate this complexity become a bottleneck for the organization.&#x20;

Instead of creating Jira-Tickets or following up 3 times on an e-mail, you can just ask Dot - the data bot. Dot is trained by the data team to answer all the flexbile and nuanced questions about your business you care about.&#x20;

### What can you ask?

Let's look at some potential questions for the marketing team of an online-shop.

1. **Ask for help on how to analyze data.**

2. **Ask questions that need a deep understanding of your companies data model.**

3. **Request not just specific data, but also specific visualizations**

4. **Look up detailed information about customers, orders, ...**

5. **Ask for anything. Dot will not hallucinate, because it is grounded by the connected data.**

6.  **If Dot didn't find what you were looking for, just say "Try again."**&#x20;

    Dot is based on current frontier models and statistically in nature. By trying again it might choose another way to approach the question and succeed.



### How should you ask?

**Ask Clear and Precise Questions**

To get the most accurate and relevant answers from Dot, follow these best practices:

*   **Be Specific:** Clearly define what you ºre asking for.

    _Example:_ Instead of saying "I need data on suppliers," specify "I need a list of active suppliers in Region 1 for the last month."
*   **Provide Context:** Include relevant details or constraints.

    _Example:_ If you need data for a specific time period, mention it explicitly.
*   **Clarify Ambiguities:** If your question could be interpreted in multiple ways, provide additional detail.

    _Example:_ If you request "order data," clarify whether you mean GMV, number of orders, or another metric.
*   **Use Business Terminology:** Stick to the terms from the company ºs business glossary.

    _Example:_ Use "Active Buyer" instead of "buyer."
* **Ask for Help:** If you ºre unsure how to phrase your request or what data is available, ask Dot for help.



#### üíØ **Ideal Question Components**

To get the most accurate results from Dot, ensure your questions include the following components (if possible):

* **Which metrics?** Specify the exact metric you ºre looking for (e.g., revenue, number of orders, active buyers).
* **What entity?** Specify the entity you're asking about (e.g., suppliers, products, buyers).
* **During which time period?** Specify the time frame (e.g., last month, Q1 2024, July 2024.
* **At which granularity?** Specify the level of detail needed (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, region-level, country-level).
* **For which location, demographic, or specific entity?** Identify any geographic areas, demographic groups, or specific entities you want to focus on (e.g., Region 1, Paris, CUSTX).
* **Using which unit?** Specify the unit of measurement for the metric (e.g., Euros, Kilograms).



#### ‚úÖ **Examples of Good Questions**

* **What was our supplier revenue in euros for July 2024 per region in region 2 and 3?**
* **How many active premium suppliers did we have in Paris in March 2024?**
* **What is the % active users per region and per month for the first 6 months of 2024?**



#### ‚ùå Examples of Bad Questions

* **What is our current revenue?**
  * _Reason:_ No timeframe provided.
* **Which customer in Region 5 has been using our product the longest?**
  * _Reason:_ Ambiguous, does "longest" refer to since sign-up or since the first order? Which customer, buyer or supplier?
* **Can you tell me the best selling product for next month?**
  * _Reason:_ Dot does not provide future predictions.
* **Show me all orders ever placed in the system.**
  * _Reason:_ Too broad, lacks a specific timeframe or criteria.



#### :question:More help

If you're uncertain about Dot's answer, just ask the data team for help!&#x20;
