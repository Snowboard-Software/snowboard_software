Answer most business questions instantly 24/7. Data teams can focus on deep work, not on answering easy questions about dashboards.

Dot, the data bot is an intelligent virtual data assistance that answers business data questions, retrieves definitions and relevant data assets, and can even assist with data modelling.

Leverages the power of large language models combined with your data stack (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, see all [Integrations](/broken/pages/KjQsq5PzXupb6LHQwaP5)) and documentation of processes and metrics.

Ships with a developer training space that ensures the data team is in the driver seat and results from Dot are validated. Say No to hallucinations.

Ready for Enterprise usage with SOC 2 Type II compliance. Your data is a treasure. We keep it safe.
