DotML is a general purpose semantic layer, that gets developed by the Dot team to power correct, consistent and trustworthy analytics.

It can also get used to pull consistent metrics into:

* &#x20;your data science workflow (e.g. for A/B testing and experimentation)&#x20;
* your internal tools (e.g. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/))
* your data-driven applications for reporting to your customers
