# Artificial Intelligence

#### What Exactly Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence is software that allows machines to perform tasks we associate with human cognition—perceiving the world, reasoning over data, learning from experience and taking autonomous action. AI systems [mimic learning and problem-solving without aspiring to consciousness](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence).

The field ranges from rules-based “good old-fashioned AI” to modern machine-learning techniques that [infer patterns from vast data sets](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/global-survey-ai-value). What unites them is the feedback loop: an algorithm evaluates its own outputs and updates its model, steadily improving at classification, prediction or content generation.

#### Why Do Organizations Need AI?

Businesses adopt AI for straightforward economic reasons: higher revenue, lower cost and faster decision cycles. A [global survey of executives](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/global-survey-ai-value) links meaningful earnings-before-tax gains to one practice above all—redesigning workflows so humans cooperate with models rather than bolt them on after the fact.

Early adopters report a second-order benefit: organizational learning. When analysts and domain experts engage with models, they discover hidden variables, prompting better data governance and fresher metrics. A year-long [longitudinal study](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/cognitive-technologies/state-of-ai-and-intelligent-automation-in-business-survey.html) shows that the most mature enterprises are already moving beyond isolated pilots towards platforms that let multiple teams reuse models responsibly.

The strategic appeal is resilience. Markets, supply chains and consumer tastes now change faster than quarterly planning cycles. AI—especially generative models—can [explore millions of scenarios in minutes](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/competing-in-the-age-of-ai), surface weak signals and recommend micro-adjustments that compound into material gains.

_The loop shows how a business question triggers iterative data preparation, modelling, deployment and monitoring—the cycle that delivers sustainable value._

#### What Are the Main Kinds of AI?

Most production systems are **narrow AI**: models built for a single domain such as credit scoring or image tagging. Foundation and generative models widen the scope by [learning general representations and then specialising via fine-tuning](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle).

A complementary taxonomy looks at learning style. **Supervised learning** relies on labelled data; **unsupervised learning** discovers structure; **reinforcement learning** optimises sequential decisions; **neuro-symbolic systems** blend statistical pattern-matching with symbolic rules to improve reliability and transparency.

#### How Does AI Fit into the Data-Analytics Ecosystem?

Artificial intelligence does not replace analytics; it extends it. Warehouses such as [Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud](https://www.snowflake.com/data-cloud) host the raw and model-ready data; transformation layers like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com) ensure it is trustworthy; observability platforms such as [Monte Carlo](https://www.montecarlodata.com/observability) watch for drift; catalogues like [Atlan](https://atlan.com) make assets discoverable; governance suites like [Collibra](https://www.collibra.com) police risk; and consumption tools—from dashboards to natural-language copilots like [getdot.ai](https://getdot.ai)—bring insights to decision-makers.

#### What Are Typical Use Cases and Applications?

Retailers personalise promotions; banks detect fraud in real time; manufacturers [predict equipment failure](https://databricks.com/dataaisummit); telecoms optimise network traffic; and media platforms recommend content. Customers are combining governance, warehousing and real-time features to embed models in everything from supply-chain routing to biodiversity tracking.

Cloud warehouses increasingly offer in-database machine learning—[Amazon Redshift ML](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/ml) lets analysts build models with familiar SQL, removing the data-movement tax. Consumer-grade copilots such as [getdot.ai](https://getdot.ai) democratise ad-hoc exploration by translating plain-language queries into governed SQL, freeing data teams for deeper work.

#### What Should Leaders Look for When Adopting or Buying AI?

Three capabilities recur in analyst notes and buyer interviews. First is **trust in data**: a [state-of-analytics engineering report](https://www.getdbt.com/reports/state-of-analytics-engineering) ties AI success to clean lineage and testable models. Second is **continuous observability**: [AI agents](https://www.montecarlodata.com/ai-agents) automatically propose monitoring rules and trace faulty pipelines back to source, cutting downtime before users notice. Third is **governance by design**: Collibra’s [AI Governance module](https://www.collibra.com/product/ai-governance) centralises model inventories, risk assessments and approval workflows so compliance keeps pace with experiment velocity.

Prospective buyers should insist on model transparency, demonstrable business metrics rather than generic benchmarks, and integration hooks—APIs or event streams—that slot into existing data platforms, whether Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery or ClickHouse. Finally, they should budget for change-management: retraining staff and revising processes often costs more than licences.

#### How Does AI Relate to AI Analytics and Where Is It Headed?

AI analytics turns the lens back on the data function itself: models suggest metrics to monitor, generate SQL on the fly, explain anomalies in plain language and even design new experiments. Tools such as [Dot](https://getdot.ai) illustrate this shift from static dashboards to conversational insight, while vendors from Tableau to Atlan embed generative capabilities directly into catalogues and visualisation layers.

Going forward, expect three convergences. Data and model governance will fuse under unified policy engines; vector search and tabular BI will share semantic layers; and small, domain-tuned models will outnumber giant general models because cost curves are falling and fine-tuning is getting easier. The trajectory is away from discrete AI projects toward invisible, environment-level intelligence woven through every analytic workflow.
