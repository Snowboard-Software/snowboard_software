# Get Started

_Get support and advice at_ [_hi@sled.so_](mailto:hi@sled.so)

There are two ways to deploy Sled. We manage it for you in the [cloud](getstarted.md#cloud), or you host it yourself.

## Cloud

1. [Register here](https://register.s8.software/) with your work-email
2. Verify your E-Mail. Now we start your cloud instance.
3. [Prepare a technical user in Snowflake](snowflake\_connection/)
   * Write us to get support! Setting permissions can be tricky. Just using `ACCOUNTADMIN` is fast, but not a good practice.
4. Login to your instance and connect your Snowflake Account.
5. You did it! Great job. Tell your colleagues about it and explore!
